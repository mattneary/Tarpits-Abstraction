Tarpits & Abstraction
=====================
Tarpits & Abstraction is a book beginning with a discussion on Turing Machines and Lambda Calculus, and then exploring layers of abstraction, cross-interpreting, and compiling until the reader can understand computation at any layer of abstraction.

Currently, it is planned to have a preface (*A Tale of Two Theories*) and five parts:

1. Defining Symbolic Expressions
2. Simulating a Tape Machine
3. Interpreting a Language
4. Pulling Our Language up by Its Bootstraps
5. Communicating Symbolic Forms to a Register Machine

Notes
-----
###Defining Symbolic Expressions
__TODO__: 

- Equivalence between Numbers, Atoms, and Lists - an atomic `eq` based on numbers (`and (le ...) (le ...)`) and a symbolic `equal` that's recursive.

###Pulling Our Language up by Its Bootstraps
A chance to add features like `define`.
