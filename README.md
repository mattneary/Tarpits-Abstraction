Tarpits & Abstraction
=====================
View early versions of the beginning chapters as pdfs in the `build/pdfs/` folder.

Tarpits & Abstraction is a book beginning with a discussion on Turing Machines and Lambda Calculus, and then exploring layers of abstraction, cross-interpreting, and compiling until the reader can understand computation at any layer of abstraction.

Currently, it is planned to have a preface (*A Tale of Two Theories*) and six parts:

1. Defining Symbolic Expressions
2. A Library of Symbolic Functions
3. Simulating Logical Devices
4. Interpreting a Language
5. Pulling Our Language up by Its Bootstraps
6. Communicating Symbolic Forms to a Register Machine

__TODO__: An imperative language

Reading
-------
###Rendering
To get the best reading experience, you will want to run the node server in `src/render/` and connect to `localhost:8080`. Once there the LaTeX and Markdown can both render well.

###Pre-Rendered Versions
There will be some early renders posted as I progress. Browse the `build/pdfs/` folder for the latest renders.

Notes
-----
###Defining Symbolic Expressions
- __TODO:__ Dotted Lists
- __TODO:__ Discuss McCarthy's Influence
- __TODO:__ Modulo and Division functions

###A Library of Symbolic Functions
- __TODO:__ Using conditionals and `cond` function
- __TODO:__ Improve `induct` example
- __TODO:__ Newton's Method: An Example
- __TODO:__ Variables: Reference and Scope
- __TODO:__ Expansion of Programs
- __TODO:__ Exponentiation & Efficiency: An Example
- __TODO:__ Primality
- __TODO:__ Diverse Data Structures

###Simulating Logical Devices
- Lazy structures
- __TODO__: Register machines.

###Interpreting a Language
- Interpret Lambda Calculus
- Interpret a Query Language

###Pulling Our Language up by Its Bootstraps
- Laziness
- Adding features

###Pulling Our Language up by Its Bootstraps
- A chance to add features like `define`.
