Tarpits & Abstraction
=====================
Tarpits & Abstraction is a book beginning with a discussion on Turing Machines and Lambda Calculus, and then exploring layers of abstraction, cross-interpreting, and compiling until the reader can understand computation at any layer of abstraction.

Currently, it is planned to have a preface (*A Tale of Two Theories*) and six parts:

1. Defining Symbolic Expressions
2. A Library of Symbolic Functions
3. Simulating a Tape Machine
4. Interpreting a Language
5. Pulling Our Language up by Its Bootstraps
6. Communicating Symbolic Forms to a Register Machine

Reading

###Rendering
To get the best reading experience, you will want to run the node server in `render/` and connect to `localhost:8080`. Once there the LaTeX and Markdown can both render well.

###Pre-Rendered Versions
There will be some early renders posted as I progress. `SExpr-0.1.pdf` was my first one posted. Others are coming soon.

Notes
-----
###Defining Symbolic Expressions
- __TODO:__ Dotted Lists
- __TODO:__ Discuss McCarthy's Influence
- __TODO:__ Modulo function

###Pulling Our Language up by Its Bootstraps
- A chance to add features like `define`.
