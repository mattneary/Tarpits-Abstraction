Beginning with first principles, modern language features are derived and used to simulate, interpret, and compile other models of computation. There are seven chapters, most of which have been written.\r\n\r\n1. Syntax and Semantics\r\n2. Defining Symbolic Expressions\r\n3. Designing Primitive Procedures\r\n4. Simulating Logical Devices\r\n5. Mechanical Interpretation of a Language\r\n6. A Self-Hosted Language\r\n7. Communicating a Language to Machine\r\n\r\n## Compilation\r\nThe Makefile generates LaTeX for all chapters, and then renders an index LaTeX file which joins all chapters together. This outputs a pdf to `build/pdf/book.pdf`, with all LaTeX sources stored in `build/latex`. Before reading, verify that it is the newest version by running the following from the *project root*.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ make\r\n```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
